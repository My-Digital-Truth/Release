My Digital Truth is the fusion of art and technology. It emerged from and continues to evolve as part of my professional journey. These things are difficult to put into words, so this video is the first step trying to express the idea. For digital technology, this mindset is paramount.

My Digital Truth takes inspiration from that. David Bohm’s exploration into the nature of dialogue was one of his more unique contributions that extended beyond the realm of physics and into the fields of communication, philosophy, and human consciousness.
